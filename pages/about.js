            Work as a Validation Technician for 14 years. Started to learn
            Python to help automate task that would slow down and annoy the
            team. As my knowledge grew so did my desire to help with other task
            and that could bring more structure to the group.

            I have worked on a 68 mustang that was drivable for my wedding.
            Later I able to build a small black smith shop at my house, where I
            take scrap steel and pound it in to shape. I enjoy building and
            working with wood as well.
