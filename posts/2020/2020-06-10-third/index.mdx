## Content Managment System

As of today the ecomerance site does not require a CMS. but that doesn't mean that I don't need one. Listed is a few that have gain my intrest. Thanks @Santax

1. Sanity, Prismic, 8Base
2. Strapy, Keystone, Ghost
3. Hasura, Prisma
4. Foresty, Netify CMS
5. Google sheets, Airtable, Notion, old fashion Markdown

Group one are require develper to figure out how to host them
Group Two are self hosted meaning, The CMS would keep the data on thier own servers (could cost more)
Group Three are like CMS but not in the full meaning
Group four use Github as a source of truth
Group five have tendancy to be a CMS and are bare bones
