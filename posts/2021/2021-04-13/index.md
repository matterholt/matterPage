I have an idea of an app that I wish to build. Now I have a lot of ideas and side projects that I would like to work on but never seem to come to fruition. Some are lost of interest and others are unclear direction, this has to change. Knowing the problem now I am able to implement countermeasure to see the completion.

The first countermeasure is to be more public with what I'm building. So writing articles on what I have learned that week and a constant flow of tweets. Like a weekly review or similar to "stand-ups". Hopefully, this commitment with keeping the interest alive on the project.

Defining the direction for the app may be a bit tricky and may take a bit of time to work through. First, we need to view software development as a whole. Starting at the beginning, like any project we should have an idea of what needs to be built. This could get be enough to get the project off the ground but for longevity and clarity.

Common practice is creating a Software Design Document or Tech spec. This document could look different but the primary goals are the same. The first and most important is to figure out exactly what the client wants out of the application. This will reduce conflicts that may arise later in the project. The document also informs all the team members of the direction for the software.

The first, is to understand the process of software development. I plan to create one of these Software Design Documents for my projects. To narrow my scope and have a clear direction to go to complete the web application. This Software Design Document would create a foundation for my web app. Which will allow me to create goal-specific tasks to achieve the desired outcome for the application.

In conclusion, I will be doing my best to follow the typical Software development process to build my next project. The web application I'm wanting to build is a fitness application that tracks my lifting routine and weights. The repo is [workRoutines](<[https://github.com/matterholt/workRoutines](https://github.com/matterholt/workRoutines)>) if you wish to view my progress.
