    <strong>My Primary Role</strong> My commitment is foremost to my family.I
    wouldn't be the person I am without them. They're a constant source of
    support, and I actively choose to build a strong family by making them a
    priority in my daily life

    <strong>My Professional Role</strong> When it comes to web technologies, I
    consider myself a bit of a generalist, but my sweet spot is definitely in
    the front-end. I love using the web to solve real-life problems, often
    getting ideas to make things simpler. My go-to for staying in the loop is
    tuning into podcasts, and I enjoy diving into code bases to discover new
    tricks that can level up my projects. With a background in automotive
    engineering spanning decades, my coding approach is all about precision and
    accuracy. What really gets me going is improving workflows. I kicked off a
    project to streamline product removal processes and whipped up a handy site
    to support my wife in homeschooling our kids. I also write scripts to make
    life easier for my teammates, simplifying data extraction and boosting
    efficiency

    <strong>Other Roles</strong> I love stepping away from the computer to
    embrace a more hands-on lifestyle. Taking care of chickens and lambs,
    tending to my garden, and crafting projects in my small woodshop—like my
    desk and garden trellis—keep me outdoors. In the barn, my blacksmith shop
    comes alive as I hand forge knives, S hooks, and hangers. Amidst it all, I
    own a 1968 Mustang, brought back to life with a roaring 351 Windsor engine.
    I'm always on the move, enjoying a balanced and healthy lifestyle by staying
    busy, immersing myself in nature, and working on the farm.
