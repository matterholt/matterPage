## My First Interaction

It wasn't till working at the Automotive engineering company till I exposure with any kind of coding or scripting. Looking back I see different indications that would sculpt and develop me into a desire to be a full software engineer.

My first experience was working with scripting in a software program that used tcl scripts build feature to help with task with in . It wasn't too advance and was more of copy and paste into a file.

Then the tcl was limited and only was able to help on a few occasions. So looked into AutoHot keys to control the mouse on the screen that would help record results. I never dug into the code or tried to figure out how it worked, I was primary concerned with working on my automotive career.

There was a time where I was curious about about Python but ended up not being what I what I was looking for at that time. But I was still learning and constructing analysis model via text documents, which has similar coding aspect.

Then as time went by I was reintroduced to python. How it could be used to in junction with a Abaqus software to extract results from a .ODB file. I started to explore best practices and other programming techniques. The possibilities began to open up and able to see where python could help build tools that would benefit the team.

During this time of growth I looked and researched in web technologies and javascript. This was late 2017 and the web world was exploding with javaScript frameworks and other technologies. This time was dificult to learn web, looking back it was a big transition point on how the web was built. (gulp to webpack, Grapql, Component base design oppose to traditional way of ?? separation of concerns).
