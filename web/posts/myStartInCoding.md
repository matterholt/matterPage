## My First Interaction

It wasn't till working at the Automotive engineering company till I exposure with any kind of coding or scripting. Looking back I see different indications that would sculpt and develop me into a desire to be a full software engineer.

My first experience was working with scripting in a software program that used tcl scripts build feature to help with task with in . It wasn't too advance and was more of copy and paste into a file.

Then the tcl was limited and only was able to help on a few occasions. So looked into AutoHot keys to control the mouse on the screen that would help record results. I never dug into the code or tried to figure out how it worked, I was primary concerned with working on my automotive career.

There was a time where I was curious about about Python but ended up not being what I what I was looking for at that time. But I was building analysis in a text file format which in away is similar to coding practices.

Looking back I was always looking for way to use code to automate and assist with task at my job.
