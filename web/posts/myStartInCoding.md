It wasn't till working at the Automotive engineering company when I exposures to any kind of coding or scripting. Looking back I see different indications that would sculpt and develop me into a desire to be a full software engineer.

My first experience was working with scripting in a software program that used TCL scripts to build features to help with a task within. It wasn't too advance and was more of a copy and paste into a file.

Then the TCL was limited and only was able to help on a few occasions. So looked into AutoHot keys to control the mouse on the screen that would help record results. I never dug into the code or tried to figure out how it worked, I was primarily concerned with working on my automotive career. There was a time where

There was a time where I was curious about Python but ended up not being what I was looking for at that time. But I was still learning and constructing an analysis model via text documents, which has a similar coding aspect.

Then as time went by I was reintroduced to python. How it could be used to an injunction with a ABAQUS software to extract results from an ODB file. I started to explore best practices and other programming techniques. The possibilities began to open up and able to see where python could help build tools that would benefit the team.

During this time of growth, I looked and researched in web technologies and javascript. This was late 2017 and the web world was exploding with javaScript frameworks and other technologies. This time was difficult to learn web, looking back it was a big transition point on how the web was built. (gulp to webpack, Grapql, Component base design oppose to the traditional way of ?? separation of concerns).

The web is really interesting to me and would allow me to build helpful Applications. I enjoy exploring when at home and in my free time. But to get the application used at work would require a large buy-in from the company. Building small applications and scripts in Python would be the best tool to complete the task.

As of today I work in Python most of the time and dabble in web technologies. My Python consist of creating scripts that help other engineers with their projects. But the one thing that I would like to build for the group is a way to auto-generate reports or a better way of viewing and share the status of the project.

Unfortunately, I have only limited time to work on said project. My primary role in the group takes precedence over coding. This leads me to search for a career in programing. Where I can progress my knowledge of coding, to share the thing that I have to learn and to help others.
