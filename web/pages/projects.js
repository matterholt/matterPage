            My projects consist of script and app that aid in my daily work.
            Python allows me to extract or add data to the a database or a
            simple directory creation for the current project that I'm working
            on.
          </p>
          <p>
            I would like to see and create a way to share and track data with in
            the group and would allow better direction and understanding among
            the team.

      </main>
    </div>
