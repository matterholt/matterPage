        I have a decade of experience working in an engineering setting. During this
        time I was exposed to programming and decided to make it a career. I spent
        several years learning and practicing web technologies, primarily focused
        on Front-end. I spent some time using Python to build scripts for an engineering
        group. I have a year's worth of experience in multiple large-scale applications.
        My decades' worth of experience in automotive engineering helps me develop
        the soft skill to work on demanding projects, working across teams to achieve
        clients' requirements and expectations.

        In my first year as an application development, My first task was to
        learrn what technologies are used in the application. The framework is
        VUE 2 with jsx and a library that gave vue 3 composition features. Then
        was building my understanding of the business. So I am able to
        contribute to a successful application release.
