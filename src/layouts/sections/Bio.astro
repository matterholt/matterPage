    <strong>My Professional Role</strong> is working in web technologies, I
    would say that I'm a generalist, but stronger on the Front-end. I love to
    use the web to solve people's needs, most of my project ideas come from
    ideas that could make things easier. I listen to podcasts to keep up-to-date
    or find something interesting to look into. I also dig into code bases to
    see if can pull out something new and improve how I code my projects. The
    decades worth of experience working as an automotive engineer have developed
    the skills to think like an engineer. Making sure that and desire to make
    sure code is accurate and precise

    chickens and lambs to take care of and usally have a garden that help get me
    outside. I have a small wood shop where I can make projects like my desk and
    garden trellis. I got a blacksmith shop in the barns, where I hand forge
    knives and S hooks and hangers. I owen a 1968 mustang that I have got it
