    <strong>My professional role</strong> is working in web technologies, Using
    the web to solve people's needs, most of my project ideas come from ideas
    that could make things easier. I listen to podcasts to keep up-to-date or
    find something interesting to look into. I also dig into code bases to see
    if can pull out something new and improve how I code my projects. The
    decades worth of experience working as an automotive engineer have developed
    the skills to think like an engineer. Making sure that and desire to make
    sure code is accurate and precise
