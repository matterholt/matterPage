Teamcenter is a project lifecycle management software created by Siemens. Which will help keep the team up to date with the most current geometry and it not only meant for the local team. With specific rules set by the admin, the suppliers can see the specific model, the sales team would be able to quote and the new model group would be able to supply their input as well. Teamcenter creates a single source of truth, allowing the whole team to view and supply feedback with out delay.

The articles to come will be focused on Application Administrator. My goal is to document the things that I have learn. I have little experience with the Teamcenter software. So I have a good start in documenting cause the position is not even created and I am not 100% sure what is required of me. but I know one thing is that I hope that I can change what I am known for in this company. I hope that the team and I can improve the current state of the company and make it better for the future.
