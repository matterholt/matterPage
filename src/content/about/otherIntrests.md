I love stepping away from the computer to embrace a more hands-on lifestyle. Taking care of chickens and lambs, tending to my garden, and crafting projects in my small wood shop—like my desk and garden trellis—keep me outdoors. In the barn, my blacksmith shop comes alive as I hand forge knives, S hooks, and hangers. Amidst it all, I own a 1968 Mustang, brought back to life with a roaring 351 Windsor engine. I'm always on the move, enjoying a balanced and healthy lifestyle by staying busy, immersing myself in nature, and working on the farm.
