Professional Role When it comes to web technologies, I consider myself a bit of a generalist, but my sweet spot is definitely in the front-end. I love using the web to solve real-life problems, often getting ideas to make things simpler. My go-to for staying in the loop is tuning into podcasts, and I enjoy diving into code bases to discover new tricks that can level up my projects. With a background in automotive engineering spanning decades, my coding approach is all about precision and accuracy. What really gets me going is improving workflows. I kicked off a project to streamline product removal processes and whipped up a handy site to support my wife in homeschooling our kids. I also write scripts to make life easier for my teammates, simplifying data extraction and boosting efficiency
