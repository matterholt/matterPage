<h2>Automotive Engineering</h2>
<p>
Started in 2005 working in automotive engineering in the research and
 development department. I have learned the importance of communication among a team.
  Developed the grit to accomplish tough deadlines and achieve difficult performance 
  targets. Most importantly how to continually learn from peers and to help others in their
   careers.
