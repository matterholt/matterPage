 In 2005 I joined the CAE / Vailidatation group, The group was a new group and
consist of 4 people including me. I needed to learn on my own, to be adaptable
to any new jobs presented to the group. Being a newly establish group
I established best practices and methods that are still in use today.

In my 10 plus years of experience, I have participated in difficult competitions

that challenge the spirit to achieve difficult performance targets. To have the grit

to accomplish projects to meet tough deadlines Above all, it is important to me to continually

learn from peers and to help others succeed in their careers.
