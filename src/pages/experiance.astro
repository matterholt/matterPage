                    In 2005 I joined the CAE / Vailidatation group, The group was a new group and
                    consist of 4 people including me. I needed to learn on my own, to be adaptable
                    to any new jobs presented to the group. Being a newly establish group
                    I established best practices and methods that are still in use today.
                    In my 10 plus years of experience, I have participated in difficult competitions
                    that challenge the spirit to achieve difficult performance targets. To have the grit
                    to accomplish projects to meet tough deadlines Above all, it is important to me to continually
                    learn from peers and to help others succeed in their careers.
