          <p>
            At the ready to help and eager to learn from others. I have been
            working with React.js and other React libraries to build components
            and web applications. NEXT.js is my go-to framework to build web
            applications. I am fairly conformable with Python Flask and Node
            Express frameworks to build a basic Backend. My goal is to keep my
            code clean and maintainable. I strive to build a product that solves
            the clientâ€™s goals and contributes to the overall success of the
            product.
