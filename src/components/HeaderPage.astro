            I spent the several years learning and practicing web development, primary
            focused on Front end. I spent some time using Python to build scripts
            for a engineering group. A years worth of experience multiple large scale
            application. My decadades worth of experiance automotive engineering
            taught me to many soft skill from handle projects, working across team,
            meeting client's expection, and working under stress to get the task
            complete for release.

            My first year of application development, I was placed on a project
            that was very demanding and placed me in sink or swim situation. My
            years of working in automotive engineering was not an issue. I did
            my best to learn the app and understand the inner workings and made
            it a point to "leave it better then the way you found it". Every
            JIRA ticket, I was assigned, I made a point to collaborate with
            other teams to complete tasks and communicate with other team
            members. I want to make the app better so I picked up some ticket in
            the back log that would improve the code base. I commuicatied with
            the project manager to ensure that the code performed as desired
            that met targets were achieved for the client.
