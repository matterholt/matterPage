            A decade worth of experience in engineering building and performing
            analysis, Started learning and working web technoliogies since 2017
            and A year of professional development on building applications. My
            current position, I have worked extensively with front-end
            technologies to build software for the browser where I resolved
            issues found in the code base and implemented new features for
            clients. Every JIRA ticket that I took on, I made a point to
            collaborate with other teams to complete tasks and communicate with
            team members to ensure that the code performed as desired and
            targets were achieved for the client.
