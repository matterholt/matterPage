      "content": " When it comes to web technologies, I consider myself a bit of a generalist, but my sweet spot is definitely in the front-end. I love using the web to solve real-life problems, often getting ideas to make things simpler. My go-to for staying in the loop is tuning into podcasts, and I enjoy diving into code bases to discover new tricks that can level up my projects. With a background in automotive engineering spanning decades, my coding approach is all about precision and accuracy. What really gets me going is improving workflows. I kicked off a project to streamline product removal processes and whipped up a handy site to support my wife in homeschooling our kids. I also write scripts to make life easier for my teammates, simplifying data extraction and boosting efficiency "

      "content": " I love stepping away from the computer to embrace a more hands-on lifestyle. Taking care of chickens and lambs, tending to my garden, and crafting projects in my small woodshop—like my desk and garden trellis—keep me outdoors. In the barn, my blacksmith shop comes alive as I hand forge knives, S hooks, and hangers. Amidst it all, I own a 1968 Mustang, brought back to life with a roaring 351 Windsor engine. I'm always on the move, enjoying a balanced and healthy lifestyle by staying busy, immersing myself in nature, and working on the farm. "
