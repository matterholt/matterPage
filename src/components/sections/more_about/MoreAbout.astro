        Top Priority My commitment is foremost to my family.I wouldn't be the
        person I am without them. They're a constant source of support, and I
        actively choose to build a strong family by making them a priority in my
        daily life

        The Others I love stepping away from the computer to embrace a more
        hands-on lifestyle. Taking care of chickens and lambs, tending to my
        garden, and crafting projects in my small woodshop—like my desk and
        garden trellis—keep me outdoors. In the barn, my blacksmith shop comes
        alive as I hand forge knives, S hooks, and hangers. Amidst it all, I own
        a 1968 Mustang, brought back to life with a roaring 351 Windsor engine.
        I'm always on the move, enjoying a balanced and healthy lifestyle by
        staying busy, immersing myself in nature, and working on the farm.

        Professional Role When it comes to web technologies, I consider myself a
        bit of a generalist, but my sweet spot is definitely in the front-end. I
        love using the web to solve real-life problems, often getting ideas to
        make things simpler. My go-to for staying in the loop is tuning into
        podcasts, and I enjoy diving into code bases to discover new tricks that
        can level up my projects. With a background in automotive engineering
        spanning decades, my coding approach is all about precision and
        accuracy. What really gets me going is improving workflows. I kicked off
        a project to streamline product removal processes and whipped up a handy
        site to support my wife in homeschooling our kids. I also write scripts
        to make life easier for my teammates, simplifying data extraction and
        boosting efficiency
