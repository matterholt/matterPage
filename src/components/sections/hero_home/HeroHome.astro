      I have had the experience to lead and release multiple projects in
      automotive. I coordinate with multiple groups and teams to accomplish
      tasks for the success of the project. Always interested in improving my
      coding skills and lending hands to others. I want to keep moving forward
      and making things better than the way I found it.
