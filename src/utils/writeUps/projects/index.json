            "details" : "The project uses Astro.build is a modern server-side templating language. Being a landing page for a business I didn’t want to ship a bunch of JS to the client. Astro ships only HTML & CSS, and less JavaScript, which allows fast pages. The Client wanted to add content about the projects that they have accomplished so I research into headless CMS and decided to use Strapi.io to handle content. For a simple email system I choose to use FORMSUBMIT. That will send e-mail to client inbox about any inquiries .The project allowed me to better understand SEO, and what needs to be on a site to get noticed. It also encouraged me to communicating and understand what the client need to accomplish their goal.",

Allowing me to experience new technologies and other methods and techniques in developing an App. I went with React Native since I had a good good understanding of REACT.js. This app challenged me do to my lack of experience in mobile development. I had to spend some time researching and understand the React Native ecosystem to build the application. First I needed to understand how to perform Optical Character Recognition. I landed on google’s ML Kit Text Recognition API which allowed me to perform the OCR functions on device. Then learning how to handle the UI, I leaned on a component library called Native Base, which helped create clean user interfaces. This project challenge me and excited me in learning more about mobile development with React Native",
