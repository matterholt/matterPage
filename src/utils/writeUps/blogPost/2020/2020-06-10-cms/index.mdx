## Content Management System

As of today the E-commerce site does not really require a CMS.
but that doesn't mean that I don't need one.

Listed is a few that have gain my interest. Thanks @Santax

1. Sanity, Prismic, 8Base
2. Strapy, Keystone, Ghost
3. Hasura, Prisma
4. Foresty, Netify CMS
5. Google sheets, Airtable, Notion, old fashion Markdown

Group one are require developer to figure out how to host them
Group Two are self hosted meaning, The CMS would keep the data on their own servers (could cost more)
Group Three are like CMS but not in the full meaning
Group four use Github as a source of truth
Group five have tendance to be a CMS and are bare bones
