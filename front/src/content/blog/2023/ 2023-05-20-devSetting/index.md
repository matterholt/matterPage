# 2023 Developer Set up

Here is snap shot of how I have my development set up in 2023.

## Hardware

- Desk is a home made table, fairly simple, there is plans to convert it to a standing desk when I'm able to dedicated some time to it.

- Key board is carried over from previous year, but it is a Keycron K2 wireless. I have modded it a bit and changed the key caps, for Epomaker Ruby keycap set.

- Mouse is carry over as well, Logitech G305

- Monitor is a LG ultra wide, resolution of 2560x1080, nothing too crazy, not even curved. gets the job done.

- Speakers, cheep logitech, most of the time I use headphone. One day I would like to get a nice set.

- Computer, MinisForm mico computer. Nothing crazy but I am able to do some light weight gaming and any coding project. Prior was a 2013 13inch Mac. It served me well for several years, but started to get bogged down and gave it to the kiddos for school.

  - CPU: AMD Ryzen 9 6900HX with Radeon Graphics (16) @ 3.300GHz

  - GPU: AMD ATI 34:00.0 Rembrandt

  - Memory: 4127MiB / 29805MiB

## Software

- Operating System, for personal is linux disto Pop!\_OS. It pretty easy and didn't require huge amount of set up to get things going.

- Browsers I really like Arc, but unfortunately it is only for Macs, so for my personal computer I have been trying Brave. I have firefox/chrome installed.

  > Arc is my daily driver, on my work station. I love it. I have it set up for have a several workspaces, fist one is anything related to my job, so JIRA, Email and Gitlab. and any other links that I need to complete my daily task. The 2nd work space is research, any developer techs that I'm interested in. Last section is a personal space with music and other random stuff. The app only runs on a chrome browser so Google Chrome is my development browser.

- Terminal: Alacritty, made the switch because it was minimal. I wanted learn about it and see what I could do with it. Previously I used iterm2 with ohMyZsh. it's was good but I wanted to learn more not just install and use only half of the features.

- More Terminal Apps and stuff

  - starship, create custom command prompt
  - neofetch, display pc details on terminal
  - repospec, gives details on the repot\_\_NEED TO CONFIRM
  - zelij, able to 'window; the terminal screen.
  - htop, pc system monitor for terminal
  - Helix: really dope terminal text editor, like vim but has pop up that help with the action.

For on the clock, I use a 2019 16 Mac. Most of the software is used in both setups, except the browser. but hope one day I can use the browser on linux.
