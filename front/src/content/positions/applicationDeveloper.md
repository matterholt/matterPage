Maintained code base for 3 applications, Updated UI to match creative and add desired features requested from clients. Fix any bugs or issues found in the application. Orchestrate with groups to ensure that the app can be released seamlessly.Tech used is Vue.js with composition API.

## Highlights

- Tossed early into a large complicated project, before I could finish my training. This required me to quickly learn the application and start contributing to the project. To learn about Jira ticketing system, Code reviews with other teammates, and the Agile process.
- Opportunity to add a feature to a menu board that switches out content at a specific time. Instead of polling the time, choose to use setTimeout(), for better performance. Creating tests to capture the range of time and durations possible.
- Build a dynamic order feature, This would activate on a specific payload key, when active would have to animate several components, and would need logic to compare and maintain changes in payload to update UI.
- Saw an opportunity to enhance developer experience on an internal tool. Added a new feature for persistent data. Researched implantation, wrote tests to ensure functionality, and was able to handle large payloads.
- Updated application for a standardization effort. Commonize standard components across applications. Implementing a CI/CD process in GitLab. Cleaning out the old NPM package and others are up to date with other applications.
