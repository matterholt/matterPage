Develop and maintain the life cycle of suspension products. Create documents and drawings for projects assigned to me. Work with OEM to fully capture design requirements. Coordinate with the Test and Validation group for best performance of products.

### Highlights
- Catia V5 modeling, Model 3D geometry that maintains a clean working history, So that models that could be easily updated and tweaked for better performance.
- GD&T geometrical product specification training, create 2D drawings that provided tolerances for allowable prototypes
- Researching into creating Catia macros with Python. Looked into libraries and possible ways to improve engineers' development experience and help with speed.
- Created Python scripts and REST backend that help improve work efficiency and accuracy.Â
