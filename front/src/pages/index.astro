        I have an engineering background so building things with purpose is
        alway on my mind. Many skills gained in automotive engineering transfers
        to coding working on a team to ship products. My work daily in the
        frontend Vue mostly use personal projects with react , I've got a pretty
        good grip on that. Dabble in the backend for personal projects. I like
        the Python ecosystem, use it for scripting/scraping and general
        programming.
