        A decade as an automotive engineer turned developer. Driven to build
        purposeful projects that help the goals of the company. Experience
        gained in engineering translates well to coding, especially in
        collaborative, product-focused environments. Skilled in modern frontend
        development using Vue and React, with modern HTML/CSS practices.
        Comfortable with back-end tools like Hono.js and FastAPI, and enjoy
        working in the Python ecosystem for scripting, scraping, and general
        programming. A versatile contributor who adapts quickly across the
