I have been coding for about 3 year now. I have also jumped from learning back-end and front-end fundamentals and python scripting. There is a lot of bouncing around but I always end up writing front-end with React. I really enjoy it, and I want to make a career in the web developement and be a good react developer. So I'm narrow my focus and I plan to take at least 5 courses within a week. The week of the 4th is my current company will be shutdown and I will have 10 days including weekend to complete Frontend Masters React.js course and some extras. Should be no problem, I would have to lock my self in a room without distraction, like quarantine :|. Too soon, Anyway But my goals are to not to rush through it cause I really understand how react works and how to use the tool to the best of it's ablility and find those short comings.

## Dates

June 27 -> July 6th

I have 6 courses that I am interested in, and I have full days to focus and commit to the courses!

## Main Courses:

1. Complete Intro to React V5
2. Intermediate React V2
3. State Management V2
4. Client-side GraphQl
5. Testing React Applications V2
6. React Native, V2

This is the start

So to make sure that I not just see and type, but to understand the inner workings of React. I plan to post what I am learning, Document what I do, stints from the years of working for a R&D engineering company. So Tweeting, linked in, maybe reddit or DEV, but definetly on my personal blog (so here).

For the future I hope to revist the fundamentals to stay fresh and not miss something.
