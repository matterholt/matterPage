Start documenting the things that I have learn, Practice writing and sharing with others

## Build V2

Use Gatsby - Static Site 

hand built (no boilerplate), followed a tutorial to gain understanding on the workings of Gatsby, Graphql.

## Plugins

emotion-plugin ??
gatsby-plugin-mdx
gatsby-source-filesystem

## Items that could use a little bit more understanding

Better understanding on graphql, limited exposure to the technologies. I need to run throught the base. 

gastby-node.js file -> Kind of understand but on what should and how
